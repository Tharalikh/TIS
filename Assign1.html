    <h1><strong>Assignment 1: Report and Video on Visit to NALI</strong></h1>

    <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
    <p> The first Assignment is a visit to NALI 2023 event held in UTM
        Nali stands for New Academia Learning Innovation. A place where many groups of people share
        their new innovation in learning.
        For example "LEARNING COMMERCIAL LAW USING KAHOOT! FOR NON-LAW BACKGROUND STUDENTS"
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Reflection</h2></strong></h2>
                <p>
                    I felt that this innovation can lead the world of learning to be more fun
                    and the point of view of studying will be more enjoyable in the future.
                    Honestly, I have tried this Innovation for a different subject and I felt the enjoyment of using
                    it. Usually, the teacher/lecturer gives Kahoot! quiz using the element of Kahoot! Quizzes to test
                    the students' understanding after they are done explaining about the topics. Another advantage is
                    that students do not have to feel afraid when they answer the question incorrectly. Because by that
                    mistake we can get a new lesson and enhance our understanding of the topic.
                    I realize that this innovation can support learning methods to be on another level. Since most
                    of the students are always on their gadgets, we can use this as an advantage to study everywhere and
                    anytime.

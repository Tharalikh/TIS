                <p>
                    My name is Atharalikh Baihaqi Mubarak, and I am enrolled in a degree program at Universiti Teknologi
                    Malaysia (UTM).
                    I am a first-year student pursuing a course in Software Engineering.
                    Please take a look at my work from the Technology and Information System class.

                <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
                <p>
                    The first Assignment is a visit to NALI 2023 event held in UTM
                    Nali stands for New Academia Learning Innovation. A place where many groups of people share
                    their new innovation in learning.
                    For example "LEARNING COMMERCIAL LAW USING KAHOOT! FOR NON-LAW BACKGROUND STUDENTS"
                </p>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    I felt that this innovation can lead the world of learning to be more fun
                    and the point of view of studying will be more enjoyable in the future.
                    Honestly, I have tried this Innovation for a different subject and I felt the enjoyment of using
                    it. Usually, the teacher/lecturer gives Kahoot! quiz using the element of Kahoot! Quizzes to test
                    the students' understanding after they are done explaining about the topics. Another advantage is
                    that students do not have to feel afraid when they answer the question incorrectly. Because by that
                    mistake we can get a new lesson and enhance our understanding of the topic.
                    I realize that this innovation can support learning methods to be on another level. Since most
                    of the students are always on their gadgets, we can use this as an advantage to study everywhere and
                    anytime.

                <p>
                    For the second Assignment, we have an opportunity to join an industry talk with Clarity
                    Techworks SDN BHD In this talk, we have the advantage of knowing what is like to work in a
                    real-world all of the
                    speakers describe what kind od work they do. How do they manage to work there, what they learn
                    before they join the company and so on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was a great experience with Clarity Techwork. One of the inspiring talks by Mr. Yee Soon Tuck
                    himself, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the company, was that he did not even have degree
                    qualifications when he started working in IT. This reminds us that in order to get a job, not
                    only we have to rely on theoretical knowledge but also practical knowledge. Besides, attitude is
                    important since it is one of the most important aspects of working in an environment. We see
                    this talk as an advantage for the students to expose themselves to their career jobs in the future.
                    This allows them to develop their cohesive skills and responsibilities.

                <p>
                    In this assignment, we had the opportunity to join an industry talk with UTM Digital, then a
                    couple of days later, we went to UTM Digital. We explored how they maintain the university on
                    behind. We started in their office where they all working and having a meeting. After that, they
                    taught us about the Wi-Fi, database, and many more.

                    During the virtual talk which held on the 5th of December. There are 6 speakers with different
                    divisions who are willing to give their experience in UTM Digital we learn how they strengthen
                    academia-centric service delivery through a data-driven digital ecosystem, how data center
                    construction works, how they manage the network all over the UTM, how they manage the security
                    so that there are no data leaked, and the information system and issue of development in UTM And
                    then we visited their office where they showed us about what they are talking about in the virtual
                    talk.

                <p>
                    For this last assignment, we join another virtual talk with a former UTM student talking about
                    System Development @ Credence (TM Subsidiary)

                    Ms. Qistina Azman delivered an insightful presentation on System Development, providing us with
                    a comprehensive understanding of its practical applications in real-world scenarios. As I aspire
                    to become a System Developer in the next four years, I recognize the importance of continuous
                    learning and exploration, especially given the rapid advancements in technology. Furthermore, I
                    acknowledge the significance of teamwork in managing large and complex projects. I am confident that
                    with
                    consistent effort and dedication, I will achieve success in this field.

                <p>
                    We also had a lab exercise which is PC assembling. First of all, they asked us to disassemble
                    the PC then assemble it back.

                    It was a fun experience where we learned to disassemble a PC by:
                </p>
                <ul class="left-align">
                    <li>Open the case by unscrew it</li>
                    <li>Take off the cable</li>
                    <li>Take off the Power supply</li>
                    <li>Take off the RAM</li>
                    <li>Take off the Hardisk Drive</li>
                    <li>Take off the fan</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    And then we assemble it back by doing it backward together with my group.

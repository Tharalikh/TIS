    <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
    <p>
        In this assignment, we had the opportunity to join an industry talk with UTM Digital, then a
        couple of days later, we went to UTM Digital. We explored how they maintain the university on
        behind. We started in their office where they all working and having a meeting. After that, they
        taught us about the Wi-Fi, database, and many more.

    <h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>
    <p>
        During the virtual talk which held on the 5th of December. There are 6 speakers with different
        divisions who are willing to give their experience in UTM Digital we learn how they strengthen
        academia-centric service delivery through a data-driven digital ecosystem, how data center
        construction works, how they manage the network all over the UTM, how they manage the security
        so that there are no data leaked, and the information system and issue of development in UTM And
        then we visited their office where they showed us about what they are talking about in the virtual
        talk.

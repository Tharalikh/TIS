    <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
    <p>
        We also had a lab exercise which is PC assembling. First of all, they asked us to disassemble
        the PC then assemble it back.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>
    <p>
        It was a fun experience where we learned to disassemble a PC by:
    </p>
    <ul class="left-align">
        <li>Open the case by unscrew it</li>
        <li>Take off the cable</li>
        <li>Take off the Power supply</li>
        <li>Take off the RAM</li>
        <li>Take off the Hardisk Drive</li>
        <li>Take off the fan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        And then we assemble it back by doing it backward together with my group.

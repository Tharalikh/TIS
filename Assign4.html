    <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
    <p>
        For this last assignment, we join another virtual talk with a former UTM student talking about
        System Development @ Credence (TM Subsidiary)
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Ms. Qistina Azman delivered an insightful presentation on System Development, providing us with
        a comprehensive understanding of its practical applications in real-world scenarios. As I aspire
        to become a System Developer in the next four years, I recognize the importance of continuous
        learning and exploration, especially given the rapid advancements in technology. Furthermore, I
        acknowledge the significance of teamwork in managing large and complex projects. I am confident that
        with
        consistent effort and dedication, I will achieve success in this field.

    <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
    <p>
        For the second Assignment, we have an opportunity to join an industry talk with Clarity
        Techworks SDN BHD In this talk, we have the advantage of knowing what is like to work in a
        real-world all of the
        speakers describe what kind od work they do. How do they manage to work there, what they learn
        before they join the company and so on.

    <h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>
    <p>
        It was a great experience with Clarity Techwork. One of the inspiring talks by Mr. Yee Soon Tuck
        himself, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the company, was that he did not even have degree
        qualifications when he started working in IT. This reminds us that in order to get a job, not
        only we have to rely on theoretical knowledge but also practical knowledge. Besides, attitude is
        important since it is one of the most important aspects of working in an environment. We see
        this talk as an advantage for the students to expose themselves to their career jobs in the future.
        This allows them to develop their cohesive skills and responsibilities.
